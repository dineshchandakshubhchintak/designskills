                        <p>2D animation is the traditional animation method that has existed since the late 1800s. It is one drawing followed by another in a slightly different pose,on and on for 24 frames a second. 3D animation (aside from stop-motion, which really is a form of 3D animation), is completely in the computer.</p>

                        <p>2D animation is the traditional animation method that has existed since the late 1800s. It is one drawing followed by another in a slightly different pose, followed by another in a slightly different pose, on and on for 24 frames a second</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4 class="text-uppercase">Methodology</h4>

                        <p> Traditionally these were put together in an amazing process where artists drew pencil drawings of every frame of film, then these images were painted onto clear plastic sheets called ‘cels’, and each of the thousands of handrawn and painted cels were photographed one at a time over a hand painted background image and those thousands of images compiled to run as film at 24 frames a second. In 2D animation EVERYTHING is drawn</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-30 line-height-1 text-uppercase text-left">Creation<span class="text-theme-color-2">   </span></h4>

                        <p>When an object is created with X and Y axis i.e. the width and Height it is in 2D (two Dimensional)</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>2D animation consists of frames and carries no realistic feather in them </p>

                        <h4 class="mb-30 line-height-1 text-uppercase text-left">Usage<span class="text-theme-color-2">   </span></h4>

                        <p>Sectors where 2D animation is widely used are 2D animated movies, television advertisements, cartoons, films, video games, engineering demos, websites, e-learning and many more. </p>

                        <p>Adobe After Effects, Adobe Flash Professional, Motion, Toon Boom, and Anime Studio are some of commonly used software used to create 2D animation </p>

                        <p>Eg : Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd. Snow White, The Jungle Book, The Little Mermaid , The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park </p>

                        <h4 class="text-uppercase">Definition</h4>

                        <p>3D animation (aside from stop-motion, which really is a form of 3D animation), is completely in the computer. Things that you create in a 3D animation program exist in an X, Y & Z world. Instead of a drawing of a globe, I have a sphere that can actually turn 360 degrees.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4 class="text-uppercase">Methodology</h4>

                        <p>3D objects, once modeled, can be treated almost as a physical object. You can light it differently, you can move a camera to look at it from above, or below.

                          <br> In 3D is simply dragging it to another position to see if you like it better.

                          <br> 3D allows you to create realistic objects. You can use textures and lighting to create objects that appear solid, and can even be integrated seamlessly into live video elements</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4 class="mb-30 line-height-1 text-uppercase text-left">Creation<span class="text-theme-color-2">   </span></h4>

                        <p>When an object is created with X,Y and Z axis i.e. the width, Height and Depth it is 3D (three Dimensional)</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>3D supports real Depth background</p><br>

                        <p style="font-size:16px;">3D animation comprises of movements and carries realistic appeal in them </p>

                        <p>Sectors where 3D animation is widely used are Architecture, Medical, and Aerospace, Engineering, biotechnology, gaming industry, movies and many more. </p>
