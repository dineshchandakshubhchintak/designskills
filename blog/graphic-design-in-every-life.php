                    <h4 class="mb-30 line-height-1 text-uppercase">Graphic Design is <span class="text-theme-color-2"> Everywhere</span></h4>

                    <p> You should be familiar with the following:</p>

                    <p>Not everyone is aware that it takes a graphic designer who has the principles and the knowledge about the field of design to produce websites, billboards, informational signs, symbols, labels, logos and many other products.</p>

                    <p>In fact, the design has gained importance over the years that normal life would not be able to function without having good design supporting the race.</p>

                    <p>Imagine a society where graphic design does not exist. In such a case there would be no base for functionality and everything would be in mayhem. Let’s take some examples: With no visual representation of road signs and symbols, it would be difficult for those commuting through a road to understanding the rules that they need to abide by. Newspapers would look like long books, there would be no categorization of topics that the newspapers of today have. In short, it would be difficult to read. Without graphic designing, there would be no way to communicate information in a concrete manner to the general public. Like olden times, everything would be written or spoken. Businesses would not be able to make themselves known without billboards and websites. Products would not be designed in a functional way and problems would be faced in completing tasks that have been made simple today. In short, life without graphic design would be dull, mundane and extremely difficult.</p>
